## Marley Accel

A small Linux (user space) mouse accel driver. It allows for acceleration that is frame rate independent and consistent across applications and games.  
A primary feature is that it supports the Quake accel settings!

#### Requirements

There are only a few requirements (most of which are installed on Linux?):

* A C compiler
* pkg-config
* libusb-1.0
* uinput (kernel module)

#### Usage

This is what I'm working on now :)  
Want it to be easy to install and configure settings.
