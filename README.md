## Marley Accel

A small Linux user space mouse accel driver that supports the quake live accel settings. It allows for acceleration that is frame rate independent and consistent across applications and games.

#### Requirements

There are only a few simple requirements:

* A C11 compiler
* pkg-config
* libusb-1.0
* uinput (kernel module)

#### Usage

This is what I'm working on now :). I want to it to be simple to configure settings.
