## Marley Accel

A small Linux user space mouse accel driver. It allows for acceleration that is frame rate independent and consistent across applications and games.  
Supports Quake accel settings!

#### Requirements

There are only two requirements:

* libusb-1.0
* uinput (kernel module)

#### Usage

This is what I'm working on now :)  
Want it to be easy to install and configure settings.
